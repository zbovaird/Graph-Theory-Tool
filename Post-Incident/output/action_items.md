# Incident Response Action Items

## Priority Actions

| Priority   | Category             | Finding                                                             | Action                                                                                |
|:-----------|:---------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HIGH       | Network Segmentation | Critical node 23 could split network into 4 segments if compromised | Implement redundant paths around node 23; Consider network segmentation at this point |
| HIGH       | Network Segmentation | Critical node 5 could split network into 3 segments if compromised  | Implement redundant paths around node 5; Consider network segmentation at this point  |
| HIGH       | Network Segmentation | Critical node 14 could split network into 3 segments if compromised | Implement redundant paths around node 14; Consider network segmentation at this point |
| HIGH       | Attack Vector        | Critical path identified: 2 -> 5 -> 12                              | Implement access controls and monitoring along this path                              |
| HIGH       | Attack Vector        | Critical path identified: 5 -> 2 -> 6                               | Implement access controls and monitoring along this path                              |
| HIGH       | Attack Vector        | Critical path identified: 6 -> 2 -> 5                               | Implement access controls and monitoring along this path                              |
